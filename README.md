# password_generator
It is dangerous to use same password for every site.
If your passwords are involved in a hack, all your web data is at risk. I developed Password Generator to help with strong and random passwords that are different.

If the site has specific password requirements, you can easily adjust the settings to tailor the results to those requirements.
